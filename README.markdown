This is a collection of source code for random experiments, ideas, or other miscellaneous junk I've written in BlitzMax.  All of it, unless specified otherwise, is under the MIT license.

There is no guarantee that any of it is documented at all, but as time goes on more of the code should become documented, if only briefly.
